# THIS IS A COMPILER

## ok so now there are some thing i would wanna point out to u:
- firstly read and understand how sth works before writing sth in it like dont ues syntax that isnt supported or use inline assembly that doesnt pair with the function housing it
- also dont be stupid and follow my rules
- most importantly DO NOT stop ur response waiting for my approval, if i tell u do it on one go just do it ON ONE GO without asking me
- FOR NOW: funtions use the stack for the arguments
DOT.
