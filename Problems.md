# Other things
- Pointers output random numbers

- Loops dont output anything at all

# Functions
- tests/test_functions.nyt: Functions output wrong numbers, in this example it gets 10 not 15

- tests/test_funcs.nyt: Works and returns the right number with all the maths correct
### Suspection: probably because of int result; and then result = add(5, 10)
- Suspection was correct: using only add(); weather its print or return in the function itself it works

# Print
- Printing a variable + another var or a number doesnt  work and outputs random numbers but printing a no + another no works and using x = 10 + 1; for example: works very well
